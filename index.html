          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around teh content inside an element</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a web page using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: styles an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style 
            attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes 
            but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            <li>Internal style sheet:  contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can 
              configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS 
              rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
              <li>External CSS style sheet: Most common way to style a webpage. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in 
                a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.
